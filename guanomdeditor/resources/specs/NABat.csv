Grid Cell GRTS ID,"GRTS ID number of the NABat grid cell where the survey was conducted. This is also the NABat sampling priority of the grid cell based on the GRTS master sample, for example, lower GRTS ID = higher NABat sampling priority",1,Integer,
Site Name,"A user-defined name (6-character limit) of the specific location (or point) where a detector was deployed within a single grid cell. Being consistent with site names from year to year allows for easier sorting and interpretation of the data. For example, if four stationary detectors were deployed, each within a 5 km x 5 km quadrant in the same 10 km x 10 km grid cell, Site Names used to describe the four deployment locations could be 'NW', 'NE', 'SW,' and 'SE.' Alternatively, Site Names can be based on a nearby town name, habitat type, property name, and so forth. If a mobile acoustic transect survey was conducted within the same grid, an additional unique Site Name, for example, 'DT' (mobile driving transect), would be applied.",1,String,

Land unit code,"A user-defined 4-letter abbreviation describing your study area, region, park, state, or land unit. For example, if the survey is conducted in a park or refuge, use park or refuge codes (for example, YELL for Yellowstone National Park). If the survey is not carried out in a park or refuge, the user creates a 4-letter abbreviation for Land Unit Code based on the region or larger surrounding area (for example, SOCA for South Carolina, 3LMA for Three Lakes Wildlife Management Area).
