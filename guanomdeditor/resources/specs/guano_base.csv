Filter HP,"High-pass filter frequency, in kHz.",0,float,
Filter LP,"Low-pass filter frequency, in kHz.",0,float,
Firmware Version,"Device's firmware version, in manufacturer's own descriptive format.",0,string,
Hardware Version,"Device's hardware revision or hardware options, in manufacturer's own descriptive format.",0,string,
Humidity,Relative humidity as a percentage in the range 0.0 - 100.0.,0,float,
Length,"Recording length, in seconds. This should be the ""actual length"", which will be identical to the .WAV length for direct-recorded files, but will be calculated for time-expanded recordings (.WAV length divided by TE factor).",0,float,
Loc Accuracy,"Location accuracy, in meters. This should be the Estimated Position Error (EPE); this statistical range states that 68% of measurements will fall within this radius, 95% of measurements will fall within twice this radius. EPE is calculated differently by different GPS receiver manufacturers, therefore it should be stressed that this value is merely an estimate of accuracy. Detector manufacturers may opt to estimate accuracy more coarsely if EPE is not available directly from their GPS receiver, but should express the value in the same one-sigma fashion.",0,float,
Loc Elevation,"Elevation / altitude above mean sea level, in meters.",0,float,
Loc Position,"Location that the recording was made, as a WGS84 latitude longitude tuple.",0,string,
Make,Manufacturer of the recording hardware.,0,string,
Model,Model name or number of the recording hardware.,0,string,
Note,multiline Freeform textual note associated with the recording.,0,string,
Original Filename,"The original filename as used by the recording hardware. Editing implementations should persist this value after renaming and/or editing a file as a sort of ""paper trail"".",0,string,
Samplerate,"integer. Recording samplerate, in Hz. This should be equal to the .WAV samplerate for direct-recording detectors, but should be a product of TE and the .WAV samplerate for time-expansion detectors.",0,integer,
Serial,Serial number or unique identifier of the recording hardware.,0,string,
Species Auto ID,"Species or guild classifications, as determined by automated classification. This field allows a comma-separated list of values, however some reading implementations may only be able to handle a single species per file; therefore the most ""dominant"" or ""primary"" species present in a file, when applicable, should be the first value in this list.",0,string,
Species Manual ID,"list of strings. Species or guild classifications, as determined by a human. This field allows a comma-separated list of values, however some reading implementations may only be able to handle a single species per file; therefore the most ""dominant"" or ""primary"" species present in a file, when applicable, should be the first value in this list.",0,string,
Tags,A comma-separated list of arbitrary strings so that end users may easily apply any tags / labels that they see appropriate.,0,string,
TE,"Time-expansion factor. If not specified, then 1 (no time-expansion, aka direct-recording) is assumed.",0,integer,
Temperature Ext,"External temperature in degrees Celsius. This is the temperature outside the device's housing - the ""ambient"" temperature.",0,float,
Temperature Int,"Internal temperature in degrees Celsius. This is the temperature as measured inside the device's housing, where there is an expectation of some variance from actual ""ambient"" temperature.",0,float,
Timestamp,"Date and time of the start of the recording, in ISO 8601 compatible format (see datetime specification above). It is very strongly recommended that, if UTC offset is known, it is explicitly specified rather than recording the timestamp only in UTC ""zulu"" time. This is because local time is overwhelmingly more important when it comes to bat echolocation data than is absolute UTC time; unfortunately GPS receivers provide only UTC time, and the local UTC offset for a location may vary according to political boundaries.",1,datetime,
